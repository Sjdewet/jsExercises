    <!- Question 1 -->
        <!--  variable - is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. -->
        <!-- Values coding - is a method of coding that delves into the subjective nature of the human experience. -->
        <!-- A data type - is a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. -->
        <!-- Initialisation -  to set (something, such as a computer program counter) to a starting position, value, or configuration. -->
        <!--  Variables declared by let are only available inside the block where they're defined. Variables declared by var are available throughout the function in which they're declared .  var and let can be reassigned but variables declared with const can't be reassigned.  -->
        <!-- variable scope - of a variable is its lifetime in the program. This means that the scope of a variable is the block of code in the entire program where the variable is declared, used, and can be modified.  -->
        <!-- Use a for loop to iterate over an array.
    Use a for loop when you know the loop should execute n times.
    Use a while loop for reading a file into a variable.
    Use a while loop when asking for user input.
    Use a while loop when the increment value is nonstandard. -->
    <!-- Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.  -->
